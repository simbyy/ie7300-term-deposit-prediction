Abstract:
Marketing and commercialization of any capital industry has become the need of the hour. Every industry aspires to perform
good marketing strategies for their firm so that they can make maximum profit. This is the main reason for the rise in demand
of data analytics and data science applications across domains. This project intends to explore the nation of Portugal and study
their banking strategies. This is accomplished through the example of a multinational Portuguese bank which aims to target customers
for term deposits and determine which of their clients will agree to a fixed term deposit when approached by their bank through a phone
call. The dataset was obtained from UCIâ€™s data repository and contains some strong indicators that help in executing various classification
models. Ultimately, several models were chosen to help quantify what clients will be more likely to deposit a fixed term payment as opposed
to others. The performance of these models was then compared to a baseline.
